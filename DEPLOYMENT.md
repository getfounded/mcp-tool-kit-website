This repository is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source

2. **The site will automatically deploy when you:**
   - Push changes to the `main` branch
   - Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab

## Deployment URL

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
```

For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and your repository is named `mcp-tool-kit-website`, the URL would be:
```
https://johndoe.github.io/mcp-tool-kit-website/
```

## Manual Deployment

## Troubleshooting
